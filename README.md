# View Analysis Plugin

This repository contains the **View Analysis Plugin**, a .NET-based tool designed to perform detailed spatial and geometric analysis. The plugin provides functionalities such as ray shooting, tower structure analysis, and view capturing, aimed at supporting architectural or structural analysis tasks.

## Features

- **Ray Shooting**: Implements ray tracing for spatial analysis.
- **Tower Analysis**: Includes tools for building and dividing tower structures.
- **View Capture**: Captures view data to assist in visualization tasks.
- **Genetic Algorithm (GA)**: Provides GA capabilities for optimization.

## Repository Structure

- **AnalysisComponents/**: Contains components like `MorphoInfo`, `RayShooter`, `TowerBuilder`, `TowerDivider`, and `ViewCapture`, each responsible for a unique aspect of spatial analysis.
- **GA/**: Implements a genetic algorithm to optimize certain parameters within the plugin.
- **Morpho.csproj** and **Morpho.sln**: Project and solution files for building the plugin.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- **Rhino3D** and **Grasshopper**: Ensure you have Rhino3D installed, including the Grasshopper plugin.
- **.NET Core SDK**: Needed to build the plugin. Download [here](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download).
