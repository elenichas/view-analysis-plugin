# View Analysis Plugin

This repository contains a  **View Analysis Plugin**, a .NET-based tool designed to perform view analysis on a tower massing. 
The genetic algorithm component encapsulates the logic of the design and analysis components in order to produce generations of individuals ( towers) perform view analysis in each of them, evaluate them and keep running until it converges.
## Components

- **Design**
  - **TowerBuildier.cs**
